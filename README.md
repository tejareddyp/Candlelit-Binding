Accessibility

Ensured accessibility by following best design practices, including providing useful alt text for all images. This enhances the accessibility of the website for individuals who use screen readers. Additionally, all links that use onClick to navigate instead of href are designed as buttons, making it more accessible for keyboard users.

Responsiveness

The website is meticulously designed to be highly responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices. It adapts beautifully to different screen sizes and resolutions, providing an optimal viewing experience for all users.
